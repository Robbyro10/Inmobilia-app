# Inmobilia Caracas Front-End
This is a project made with Nextjs and Tailwindcss. The Backend is made using Nestjs and MongoDB.
## Getting Started

* Rename `.env.template` to `.env`.

* For the app to work, database is needed. Clone the inmobilia-db repository and follow its instructions.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
